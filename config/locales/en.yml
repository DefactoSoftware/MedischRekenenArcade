    percentage_of_unit: "Divide the percentage asked by 100 and multiply that with the value."
    percentage_unit_to_hundred: |
                                  1. Divide the given value by the given percentage.
                                  2. You now have 1%. Multiply that again by 100.
    percentage_amount_of_amount: |
                                   1. Calculate what 1% is by dividing the value by 100.
                                   2. Then multiply that by the percentage asked.
    solution_maxisporin: |
                           You need to take a few steps for this.

                           1. Calculate how much mg you need to inject per time, so with 750mg Maxisporin per day and 3 injections you divide 750 by 3, 250

                           2. Calculate how much of the stock needs to be dissolved. With 1000mg in stock and 0.5ml needed fluid you divide 1000 by 0.5 = 2000

                           3. Divide the first result by the last. 25/2000 = 0.125ml per time
    unit_conversion: "Metric units are very nice to work with, since they are all multiples of ten (or a hundred, or one-tenth, etc) of each other. You can convert between the various different sizes by merely moving the decimal point the correct number of places."
    concentration_tablet: |
                            Concentration means how much of substance A is in substance B. This is about how much active compound there is.

                            1. Divide the active compound by the total weight of the pill

                            2. Multiply that with 100 to get the concentration
    concentration_amount: |
                            Concentration means how much of substance A is in substance B.

                            1. Divide the percentage by hundred.

                            2. Multiply the result with the medicine

    concentration_to_hundred: |
                                1. Divide the given value by the percentage, now you have 1%

                                2. Multiply that by 100 to get the result
    syringe_pump_amount: |
                           1. Divide the total amount of mg by the amount of mg per ml

                           2. Multiply that by the amount of ml
    syringe_pump_hourly: |
                           1. Divide the total amount of mg by the amount of hours

                           2. Divide the ratio of medicine and solution by each other

                           3. Divide the amount of ml per hour by the last result
    drop_iv_hourly: |
                      1. Convert the amount of liters to milliliters.

                      2. Divide that by the amount of hours
    drop_iv_amount: |
                      The medical standard is 20 drops per ml.

                      1. Multiply the amount of liters with 1000 so you have the amount in milliliters

                      2. Divide that by the amount of minutes (24 hours * 60 minutes). Now you have the amount of milliliters per minute

                      3. Multiply by 20 to get the number of drops
    oxygen_time: |
                   The amount of oxygen and the pressure decide how long you can use a cylinder. For example a cylinder with 10 liters of oxygen and the manometer is set to 110 bar.

                   1. Multiply these numbers to get the total amount of released oxygen. (110*10 = 1100)

                   2. Divide the result of the last step by the amount of liters per minute. (2 liters per minute you do 1100/2 = 550 minutes)
    oxygen_pressure: |
                       You want to know at what pressure the manometer should be set.

                       1. Divide the amount of oxygen you need by the size of the capacity of the cylinder
